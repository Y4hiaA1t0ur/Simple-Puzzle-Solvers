# Simple Puzzle Solvers

This repository contains three compact Python projects focused on solving classic logic puzzles using AI search algorithms and various state representations. Each project was originally developed as part of school practical work (Travaux Pratiques), but I expanded them as a personal challenge in algorithmic thinking and optimization.

While the core theme of the projects is algorithmic problem-solving, **TP1 and TP3** feature state representations with **bitwise operations**, whereas **TP2** adopts a more traditional approach for the 8-puzzle problem.

## Projects

### TP1 - Cube Stacking Puzzle

**Goal:** Move cubes between three tables to match a final configuration.

- States encoded as 18-bit integers, with each 2-bit segment representing a cube.
- Explores all possible moves using **BFS** and **DFS**.
- Bit masks simulate cube moves and stack behavior.
- Includes a human-readable decoding function for visualization.

### TP2 - Taquin (8-Puzzle)

**Goal:** Slide numbered tiles into the correct order.

- Solves the puzzle using **A* search** with **Manhattan distance** as a heuristic.
- State transitions generated by moving the empty space (0).
- **No bit manipulation** is used here; instead, the project focuses on heuristic search for solving the puzzle efficiently.
- Internal states are represented as tuples for ease of comparison and hashability.

### TP3 - Tic-Tac-Toe AI

**Goal:** Implement a perfect-play AI for Tic-Tac-Toe.

- State stored in just two integers:
  - `filled_mask` tracks occupied cells.
  - `items_bin` tracks human vs AI placement.
- Uses **Minimax** to calculate optimal moves with full recursion.
- Simple CLI interface for human vs AI play.

## Why Bits in Some Projects?

As a personal challenge, I encoded states using **integers and bitwise operations** in **TP1** and **TP3**. This approach helped optimize state storage and introduced me to bit manipulation in Python. While **TP2** focuses on heuristic search, all projects aim to demonstrate core problem-solving techniques.

## How to Run

Each project can be run independently. Example:

```bash
cd TP3_XO
xo.py
